* OPC Sample Code
This article is briefly describes how to setup a sample application that works with OPC clients.

Turns out that at my first day at work I had to wrestle with this stuff.. because I was looking for exchange specific solution I failed… if it had occur to me to look for a WCF specific thing it would have saved me a ton of time…

anyways here is what you need to do in your code declare these

** Code

.code how-to-bypass-ssl-validation-for-exchange-webservices-managed-api/ews.cs /START1 OMIT/,/END1 OMIT/

put this before your code executes

.code how-to-bypass-ssl-validation-for-exchange-webservices-managed-api/ews.cs /START2 OMIT/,/END2 OMIT/

and you are good to go..
